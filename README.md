# Expo CLI Build Errors: Version Mismatch and Installation Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: build failures due to version mismatches or corrupted installations.

## Problem

The Expo CLI may throw errors during build processes, often related to dependency issues or outdated packages.  This can manifest as cryptic error messages and prevent successful project builds.

## Solution

The solution involves several steps:

1. **Verify Expo CLI Version:** Ensure your local Expo CLI version matches or exceeds the version specified in your project's `package.json` file.
2. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** If a version mismatch is detected, reinstalling the Expo CLI can resolve problems with corrupted installation files.
3. **Clear Cache:** Clearing the Expo CLI cache can help resolve conflicts with cached data.
4. **Check Node Modules:** Ensure that your `node_modules` directory is up-to-date by running `npm install` or `yarn install`. 
5. **Check for Conflicting Packages:** Examine your project's dependencies for potential conflicts that might interfere with the Expo CLI.
